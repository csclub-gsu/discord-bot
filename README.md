# discord-bot

## Project Outline: (Done in our 02-03-2023 Meeting)

**Goal: To have a bot thatâ€™s capable of marking attendance for meetings, sending event reminders, providing select role capabilities (for roles like those for CS classes, interest roles), etc.**

_How?_
- Using the python-discord.py to make the bot interact with the discord server

-	Using the GitHub API to connect our discord server with the projects that we do on GitHub.
    -	We would learn a lot of machines interacting with each other by using an API (application programming interface)
-	Host the bot 24/7 for free using Amazon Web Services.
-	Using requests module in python to interact with the API

_What?_
-	Provide functionality for members to select roles in the server. (Eg. CS classes like CS 2510, CS xxxx; are you a club member or a spectator)
-	Create scheduled event reminders for the events that the club undertakes.
-	We would be able to see who on discord is doing a certain part of a project.
-	Send out attendance links for every scheduled event.

## Installation

-   After you clone the repository, run the "pip install discord.py" in the terminal.
